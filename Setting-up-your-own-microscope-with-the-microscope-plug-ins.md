These are some suggested steps to take to get your microscope setup working with Glimpse and the microscope plug-ins.  This is going to entail making a modified version of the software for your microscope. 

* The development of Glimpse was supported in part by US government grants.  To make certain that taxpayers get the most science for the money that they spent, the software is licensed under the [GPL version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt), which allows you to modify and redistribute the software for free subject to certain conditions.

* Start by installing the [required software] from NI, and Matlab

* Create an account on Github.  Install Github for Windows.

* [Clone the Glimpse repository](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/gelles-brandeis/Glimpse).  This makes a local copy for you to work with.

* Make your own *separate* Github repository to hold versions of any of the Glimpse files that you modify and any new files that you create.  You should include only modified/new files here, not unmodified copies of files from the Glimpse repository (this will help minimize the work if you ever want to update your configuration with VIs from a newer version of Glimpse).
