The microscope plug-ins consist of LabView VIs and controls that are part of the Glimpse software and run alongside the Glimpse core.  The plugins are used in controlling a microscope setup (cameras, shutters, filterwheels,...) and acquiring and saving images.

#### Hardware and supporting software
The microscope plugin require the commercial software packages listed on the [Glimpse core]() page.

Other software (e.g., drivers and the hardware manufacturer's LabView support library) will be required to use the plug-in with particular microscope hardware.  Below is information about different hardware setups we have used with microscope plugins and some pointers on getting it working with the software.
