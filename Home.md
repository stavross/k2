Glimpse is a computer program that can collect a sequence of video images from a camera, store them in digital form on a computer disk drive, and then measure movements or intensity changes of objects in the images. Glimpse is specifically designed for collecting and analyzing data from single-molecule light microscopy experiments, but is likely to be useful in a wide variety of light microscopy or more general scientific and engineering applications.

Glimpse is written in National Instruments' LabVIEW graphical programming language, so it is easy to modify for particular applications.  It is open source software licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3.
